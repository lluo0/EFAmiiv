#simulation for theory paper

##### to test if the function recovers the number of factors correctly #####
#conditions:
#1, sample size n = 100, 500, 1000
#2, latent covariance = .3, .5, .7
#3, number of factors # = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
#4, number of indicators per factor # = 3, 4, 5
#5, value of loadings: large (1-.7), medium (69.-.4), small (.39-0)
#total number of condition: 3*3*5*3*3=405, and 100reps for each condition - 405*100 = 405,000 simulations
